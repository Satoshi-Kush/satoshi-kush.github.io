              This section is about one of the things I've learned lately in life, but maybe one of the most important things that has happened to me.<br>
              Curiously, our Traditional Education Systems do not teach us Financial Education (unless you choose to do so), even though it is a really important part of our daily life.
              I started investing when I first knew about cryptocurrencies, but I never thought that would led me to learn how this world works, and how not being taught about Finance is part of the game we all find ourselves trapped into.<br>
              Not only Trading, and Investing, but also Why our world uses Dollars, Why do people invest in Gold, Stocks, and whatever they want to invest to, and the HUGE importance of it, if you don't want your money to loose it's value as time passes by.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Trading Charts</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/BTC-Halving.jpeg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>
              At <a href="https://twitter.com/akaKush0" style="color: blue;">my Twitter</a> you'll find some charts I've posted and some thoughts about them.<br>
              However, I do use <b>Trading View</b> to analyse most of my charts. If you want to take a look, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/u/akaKush/">this</a> is my profile, but I don't usually publish there.
              I prefer keeping my Analysis for myself, just in case they are wrong... ;)

            <h3>Coinstreet Limited</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/Coinstreet.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>
              One of the things that helped me improve my trading so much has been being part of the <b>Coinstreet Trading Club</b>.<br>
              Coinstreet is a Trading Club, focused on Bitcoin markets, where you can learn different strategies and apply them to the market you want.<br>
              Once you get inside the trading world, there are many, MANY scams out there waiting for people who are looking for quick and easy returns,
              and the truth is that trading is EXACTLY the opposite.<br>
              Trading is about <b>Risk Management</b>, <b>Emotions Control</b> and developing a <b>strategy</b> that works for you, and following it strictly and consistently.
              Nothing about quick and easy returns, quite exactly the other way round.
              <br>That's why I decided to stay in Coinstreet, the only group that helped me improve in my trading. There they do not send ANY Trading signals, to try to get more and more followers. There you'll just learn how to analyse the market and take your decisions by yourself.
              I've met some of my mentors there, and quickly you distinguish between someone who knows what trading is, and can really teach you, and someone who just wants to get your money.<br>
              <hr>In case you are interested in trading, and want to know more about it, either if you are just starting, or you are a seasoned trader, Coinstreet is a perfect group to meet other traders and to keep learning and sharing the information to succeed in the markets.<br>
              You can join the group by <a href="mailto:marcbosch90@gmail.com" style="color: blue;">contacting me</a> or just get to their website
              <a href="https://www.coinstreet.limited/" style="color: blue;">https://coinstreet.limited.com</a> and contact directly, telling them you found the group at my website, to request an invitation.<br>
              To get in you'll have to make an initial payment, but believe me, it has been the best investment I made if you are serious about learning how to trade, as they'll provide you with an easy to start strategy that you will be able to use during your whole life.
              <hr>
              Apart, you can read their articles in their website or in Medium, to get a glimpse of what they teach:
