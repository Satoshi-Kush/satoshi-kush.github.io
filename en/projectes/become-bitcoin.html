            <p>
              Having your own Bitcoin node is maybe one of the topics that less people is talking about, and one of the most important ones in my opionion.<br>
              <b>The final idea of Bitcoin is to reduce (and eliminate if possible) the trust in third-parties when doing transactions.</b> So forth, to have the total ceirtanty that a transaction you are about to send or receive, is really a Bitcoin transaction, you need a direct point of access to the Bitcoin network.<br>
              To say it in another way, if you do not have your own node, you are trusting that the app or merchant you are buying something from is trustworthy, and it is not scamming you. How do you really know that what you are buying in a mobile app that you just downloaded is indeed Bitcoin? The only way to know it for sure is checking that the transaction has been done in the Bitcoin network (checking the Bitcoin blockchain for your tx ID), and that effectively it has been sent to your own wallet.<br>
              Apart, having your own node is being part of the biggest revolution that has ever existed, and the more people runs their own node, the harder it will be to stop Bitcoin.<br>
              
              On the other hand, many of the other cryptocurrencies do not offer the possibility to run a node of their network in an easy way, which makes them much more centralized. Many of them have their nodes on AWS or Microsoft servers, and if those do ever fall, that network would be paralized, and you could not access your money.<br>
              
              I hope you got why it is important to have your own node running Bitcoin. In case you've got any doubt, contact me and I'll help you in everything I can.

            <h3>How can I have my own node?</h3>
            <img src="/assets/images/node.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>
              <br>The two devices that appear on the upper picture are my first nodes.<br><br>
              Nowadays many ways of having your own node exist.<br>
              The first one is executing the <b>Bitcoin core</b> directly in your computer, however this option may only be suitable for more experienced users, which have certain familiarity with Bitcoin, Linux systems and the command line (CLI).<br>
              Even if it does already have a graphical interface, Bitcoin Core is not at all intuitive, and can be difficult to manage for a newbie, which can be pretty important when you want to move money around.<br>
              Even though, if you are an experienced user, I really recommend you try having a Full Node with Bitcoin Core in an old laptop that you no longer use, and this way you won't need to buy any extra hardware component.<br><br>
              On the other hand, there are currently some companies that offer <i>plug & play</i> nodes which make the process of running your own node much easier, with a graphical interface that makes the user experience more pleasant, even if you do not have technical knowledge.<br>
              The huge majority of this node distributions, have very low hardware requirements, and almost all of them can be run on top of a <b>raspberry pi</b>, as it is a really small device (the one in the picture), which you can have next to your router, and it's electric consumption is low. Apart from the raspberry you'll also need an SD card, an storage hard drive (preferibly SSD) of 1TB or more (nowadays Bitcoin's blockchain is around 0,5TB), and the cables to connect everything together and to your router (better using ethernet to reduce latency).<br>
              Remember that the idea is to eliminate the trust given to trusted third-parties (<b>Don't trust, verify!</b>), but even if you find the process of installing your own node too difficult, many of the following enterprises offer an already assembled node, which you just need to connect to the power wall and to the internet.<br><br>I leave you some links if you want to take a look at them:

              </ul>

              <br>I'm sure that I'm leaving some node distribution, but I guess with the previous ones you do have enough to choose from. If you think I should add another node distribution to the list send me a message and I'll add it!<br>
              Obviously I'm open to doubts, and helping you in the process of running your own node.

            <h3>How does the Bitcoin network actually work?</h3>
            <img src="/assets/images/consensus.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="">
            <p>
              I know it seems stupid, but the upper picture describes how the consensus model for the Bitcoin network works, where each one of the nodes (represented by the bearded men), checks a certain transaction (or group of transactions = block) concretely, and in case that it finds it is legitimate, it broadcast the validation to the rest of the participants of the network.<br>
If the majority (51%) of nodes reach consensus about the transactions that are being done, we can have a ledger of transactions without depending on an trusted third-party that confirms which transactions have been done and which have not.<br>
Each one of the network nodes, is actually the “trusted third-party”, and the more nodes, the more decentralized is the network, as there are more people checking the integrity of the transactions.<br>
In the case you can have a device connected at home 24/7, <b>I do strongly recommend having your own node, as you'll make sure that no one is scamming you, while making the network more secure at the same time.</b> It is a win-win situation for everyone.
