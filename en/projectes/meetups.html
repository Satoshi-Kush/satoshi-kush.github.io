            <p>
              In this section you'll find a project that I started recently next to two fellow Bitcoin plebs, and one that I consider really important.<br>
Curiously, <b>our traditional education system, does not teach us financial education</b> (except if you specifically choose to do so), even if being a huge part of our daily life.
When I started investing in crypto (yeah, I started with other cryptos, not Bitcoin), I never imagined I would fall into a rabbit hole of learning how our world works, and how precisely we are not taught finance to keep us in the rat race.<br>
And this made me realise why people invest also in gold, stocks, or whatever can protect your from inflation (also know as the poor tax) and the huge importance of this act, if you do not wanna loose your money as time passes by.<br><br>
Inevitably when you have spent some time studying Bitcoin, you'll reach the conclusion that it is the best store of value that has existed, and will ever exist, due to the similar properties it has to gold, but at the same time much superior, as it consists of a digital asset, which is easy to divide, transport and make payments even with an small amount of it.<br>
This was what made me want to share this knowledge with others, and why we created <b>Bitcoin meetups</b>, completely for free, to try to reach a society with a better edge in making financial decisions.<br>
This talks are given in Catalan, (basically because we've not found anyone doing them for the Catalan community), and as I said, open to everyone and for free. Our intention is creating consciousness about Bitcoin, and generate debate around it, stop treating it as a taboo, or only seeing media news that have no fonaments behind.<br><br>
Hope to see you there!
