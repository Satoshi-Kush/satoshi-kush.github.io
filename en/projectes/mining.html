            </div>
            <p>
              When I started learning about Bitcoin, I saw many people talking about mining, but also that machines were becoming more and more expensive, and that it wasn't able for the regular Joe to mine Bitcoin without loosing money in the process.<br><br>

This made me discard mining at first, thinking that <b>I completely missed this train</b> and that only big companies were now able to mine profitably. <b> Nothing was further from the truth</b>.<br>

My suprise came when I started mining, and in about 4 months my ROI was complete, and I realised that machine would be earning “free” money until it died.<br>

Obviously the economic incentive was the one that made me get into the mining rabbit hole, and trust me, mining has a huge ground yet to be built on top of. I quickly realised the most profitable miners would be the ones who had the cheapest energy, and that was directly linked to the development of renewable energies. It was the first time in history that renewables had a <i>raison d'être</i>... But thats another story. <br>

Let's get back to <b>home-mining</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>Is it possible to mine at home without dying on the try?</h3>
            <p>
              The sort answer is <b>you should already be mining!!</b>. Even if it seems really hard, the mining industry has evolved so much, and nowadays there are many solutions that allow you to host machines at home, which only need to be plugged into electricity, and you can start earning money directly. Without worrying nor technical knowledge.<br>
Obviously this machines have some disadvantages, like the amount of electricity they consume, and the noise and heat they produce.<br>
Nothing that can't be properly solved.<br>
<b>Want to start mining at home?</b>
<br><a href="/en/contacte.html" style="color: blue;">Contact us</a> to study your particular case.
            </p>

            <h3>Do you have access or a way to generate cheap electricity?</h3>
            <p>
              In case your answer is YES, you do already have the biggest problem solved. However, for the majority of people, the answer will be no. Don’t worry, I advice you to run some calculations on the amount of electricity each ASIC consumes, the price you are paying for electricity, and the ROI you’d have in each case.<br>
              It is certainly true that in 2022, electricity prices are not cheap in the majority of the world, however with an efficient machine you can still make some juicy gains, and recover your investment in less than 2 years, of course depending on the Bitcoin’s price fluctuations.<br>
              On the other hand, if you do have solar panels, or thought on installing them at home, keep in mind that they have peaks of production, which are almost always impossible to consume. This is when mining machines come into play, which can consume all the electricity that you cannot when these peaks occur.<br>
              In case you want to start mining at home, or want to install solar panels (we do also offer the service of installing them and configuring the machines to mine when there are peaks of production), do not doubt in contacting us.

            <h3>Do I need a lot of space?</h3><br>
            <img src="/assets/images/gpu5.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="" height="75%" width="75%">
            <p>
              When Bitcoin was launched, anyone with a regular computer could mine Bitcoin without problems with their CPU. However, as many people entered the space, the requirements also grew.<br>
GPUs were the first solution found to this problem, which do not require a lot of space. In the upper picture you can see the first mining rig I assembled, which consisted on the same parts of a regular computer, but with many GPUs connected to it.<br>
Obviously, the more GPUs you had, the more computational power, and the more Bitcoin you could mine per day.<br>
              <img src="/assets/images/gpu1.jpg" class="img-responsive" height="50%" width="50%"><br>
              And the more GPUs, the more space you needed.<br>
              <br>
              Nowadays, GPUs are only used to mine other cryptocurrencies. To mine Bitcoin you now need an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). The problem of this machines is the noise and heat they produce, so in case you cannot afford to host one of them at home, you could first try mining with GPUs (don't expect profitability mining Bitcoin).
            </p>

            <h3>Can I have ASICs outdoors?</h3>
            <img src="/assets/images/s9j.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="" height="50%" width="50%">
            <p>
              The answer is yes, BUT they should be properly protected from climate changes.<br><br>
              As I said, ASICs are better to mine than GPUs, but they consume more, are noisier, and create heat.<br>
              Having them at home is more complicated than a simple GPU rig, but not impossible. There are many companies now that are building products to make home-mining easier, reducing the noise, and conducting the heat to other places to take advantage of it.
              <br>
              Take a look at this <a href="https://bitcointv.com/w/9tAT8YZ2zhoZQz4tHRUYQe" style="color: blue;">video</a> to see a great idea on how to take advantage of the heat produced by ASICs, or read this <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/upstream-new-blackbox-for-home-bitcoin-mining" style="color: blue;">article</a> to see how outdoor mining systems work.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
              Without doubt, mining at home is not an easy task, but there is no better way to acquire <b>non-KYC Bitcoin</b> directly from your machine or machines. <br>
              If you like the idea of generating passive income with Bitcoin mining, stop buying Bitcoin and start mining (or do both!).
