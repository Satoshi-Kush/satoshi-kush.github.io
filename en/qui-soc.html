                  <h3>Sovereignty & Freedom</h3>

<p>Privacy is a fundamental right, essential to autonomy and the protection of human dignity, serving as the foundation upon which many other human rights are built.<br>
In modern society, the debate around privacy is focused on individual liberties.<br><br>
As you know, technology can be a double edged sword in this aspect, and this is why it is our obligation to <b>learn how to use it correctly.</b>
<br><br>Even if it seems that the Internet has been around for ages, it is a pretty new technology, which only big corps have taken advantage of.
<br>Until today.<br>
Now we have new tools, which let us free ourselves from the control imposed to us by giving so much personal data in a fully open way, and become the only ones who control our data, while we stop being a product for data brokers.<br>
If you do not even know where to start, but you'd like to have a major control over your data, or simply you want to know why Bitcoin is the last hope we've got to avoid being drawn into a social punctuation system, take a look at my <a href="/en/sobirania.html" style="color: blue;">resources</a> page, or <a href=”/en/contacte.html” style="color: blue;">contact</a> me and I'll be happy to have a chat with you.
<br><br><b>Fix the money, fix the world.</b><br><br>
</p>

<h3>Systems Egineer during the day.<br><br>Contributing to the best monetary network that has ever existed <del>during the night</del> 24/7.</h3>
<p>Having a tech background has helped me to understand better the enormous complexity around building secure systems, and how this is linked to the Bitcoin network.
<br><br>During my last university years, I worked as a system administrator, what allowed me to unite both worlds, and search for ways of reducing the complexity of them for the general public.<br><br>
This is the main reason why I offer services where both disciplines are mixed, from <b>designing secure networks</b>, to the protection of them, either if they are an enterprise network or a home network, and <b>implementing financial services with Bitcoin & Lightning nodes</b>. Running your node allows you to be “your own bank”, either if you want to sell a product or service for Bitcoin, or if you just want to have a trustworthy access to the Bitcoin network.<br>
Additionally I also offer <b>Bitcoin mining services</b>, for individuals and for enterprises, from the <b>feasibility study</b> to the <b>installation and implementation of the mining operations</b>, as well as the <b>maintainment</b>  of them.
